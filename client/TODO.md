- make wd-tagger work in docker (probably need to specify its port)
- page showing keyboard shortcuts
- buttons on post details to go to previous/next post (in the same pill as the edit and delete buttons)
- add user management page
- implement tags page
- handle permissions for different user roles
- add post viewing modes on post details page (fit to screen etc)
- add fullscreen toggle for post details page (e.g. pressing F shows the image fullscreen)
- look at other missing features based on the API docs (e.g. posts have comments)
- manual bulk tagging (writing a list of tags, and applying to multiple posts)
